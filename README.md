## Abstract
In the evolving landscape of professional social networks, LinkedIn represents a key platform for career-oriented engagement and strategic networking. This project implements a structured NLP-based sentiment analysis pipeline using the **TextBlob** library to classify user-generated contentâ€”such as posts, comments, and recommendationsâ€”into **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral** sentiments.

### Key Research Hypotheses:
1. **Networking Behavior Hypothesis**: Professionalsâ€™ connections are intentional and career-driven.
2. **Content Interaction Hypothesis**: Content sentiment varies with seniority level, industry sector, and career stage.

#### Methodology
